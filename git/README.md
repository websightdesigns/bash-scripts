Git Repository Script
=====================

These bash scripts can be used to simplify the process of managing your git repositories via the command line.

To make the addrepo and delrepo commands available to all users of the system, make sure the scripts are executable and place them in the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

To make the commands available only to the root user, place them in the `/usr/local/sbin/` directory instead.

Please note these scripts were written to run on the Slackware Linux distribution, and may need modifying before they will work on distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS.
