Apache Virtualhost Scripts
==========================

These bash scripts can be used to simplify the process of managing your Apache Virtualhosts via the command line.

To make the addwebsite, delwebsite, and resite commands available to all users of the system, make sure the scripts are executable and place them in the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

To make the commands available only to the root user, place them in the `/usr/local/sbin/` directory instead.
