Util Scripts
============

This bash script can be used to simplify the process of searching the files in a given directory and its subdirectories for a string.

To make command available to all users of the system, make sure the script is executable and place it in the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

To make the command available only to the root user, place it in the `/usr/local/sbin/` directory instead.
