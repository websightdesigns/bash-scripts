Multitail Script
================

This bash script can be used to simplify the process of tailing your Apache access logs and error logs.

To make command available to all users of the system, make sure the script is executable and place it in the `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

To make the command available only to the root user, place it in the `/usr/local/sbin/` directory instead.
